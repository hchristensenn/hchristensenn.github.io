            <th>Hi, I'm Hanna!! I was born in Portland, Oregon and had spent most of my life in the northwest until I moved to California in 2013. Right now, I'm a sophmore in high school and this is my fifth year at Linfield. In my free time I enjoy traveling, skiing, hiking, biking, and spending time with my friends and family.</th>
